\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This report handles the design of a neural network to forecast the hourly Belpex, electricity, prices for the period from 23/01/2024, at 00:00, to 25/01/2024, at 23:00. Its main focus is to explore the impact of different hyperparameters and architectures on the performance of the model.
\\ \\
First, the data will be preprocessed to ensure that it is suitable for the neural network in Section \ref{sec:data_preprocessing}. Then, the input will be analysed, discovering trends and impact of the different features on the model output in Section \ref{sec:feature_selection}. The model will be designed in Section \ref{sec:model_design}, where the hyperparameters and architectures will be defined. Next, the model will be trained, validated, and tested in Section \ref{sec:model_training}. Finally, the performance of the model is discussed, elaborating further on the results and potential improvements in Section \ref{sec:Performance}.
